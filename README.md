<h1>About me</h1>

I recently completed my masterâ€™s in applied data science and Analytics from San Jose State University. 

My recent work involves developing a Generative AI based restaurant chatbot that can assist customers with booking tables, inquiring about the menu, and placing orders. My work gave me an exposure to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), fine-tuning of Auto-Regressive Large Language Models, LLM evalution methods and Knowledge Graphs.

Prior to this, I gained machine-learning experience through my two internships. 
  â€¢	Completed my 2023 summer internship as a Machine Learning Engineer at Hologic, where I engineered a comprehensive solution that combined vision and language processing to address the breast cancer detection and annotation problem, utilizing advanced techniques like CLIP vision transformers on an dataset of 11,000 image-text pairs from medical reports using LLM prompting techniques.
  â€¢	I gained practical experience as an AI Engineer Intern at nth Venture, a startup eco-system where, I developed a predictive model that assessed the likelihood of customer calls converting into product sales.

Before my Masters, I also worked as a senior engineer in software industry for 8 years with IBM and UHG/OptumRx where I have worked extensively on Object Oriented Programming both in Python and Java to develop and validate various healthcare functionalities. I have also have led a team to finalise the client requirements, design solutions and also develop code.

Overall, my academic expertise, practical exposure to cutting-edge technology stacks through internships, and substantial software industry expertise positions me to contribute significantly to problem-solving, technical innovation, and collaborative team environments, making me an ideal fit for this role. My commitment to keep up to date with recent advancements and a proactive "can learn and can do" attitude make me confident in delivering valuable contributions.
